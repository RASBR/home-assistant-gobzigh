## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Modern Home Assistant Integration
- **Config Flow Setup**: User-friendly configuration with validation
- **Device Discovery**: Automatic discovery like Shelly integration
- **Device Registry**: Proper device consolidation by MAC address
- **Entity Registry**: Unique IDs and proper entity management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

### ✅ Device Support
- **WLSV0 (Liquid Level)**: Complete sensor suite with calculations
- **OTHV0 (Other Devices)**: Basic monitoring framework
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new device types

### ✅ Entity Types Created

#### Sensors (11 per liquid level device):
1. **Main Sensor** (cm) - Raw distance reading with all attributes
2. **Tank Height** (m) - Physical tank height
3. **Tank Width** (m) - Physical tank width  
4. **Tank Length** (m) - Physical tank length
5. **Sensor Distance** (m) - Sensor mounting distance
6. **Water Height** (m) - Calculated liquid level
7. **Current Volume** (m³) - Current liquid volume
8. **Max Volume** (m³) - Maximum tank capacity
9. **Fill Percentage** (%) - Tank fill level
10. **Connection Status** - Device connectivity state

#### Switches:
- **Relay Switch** - Device relay control (when supported)

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **State Classes**: Proper measurement classification for statistics
- **Device Classes**: Correct HA device classes for units and display
- **MAC Address Combination**: Devices merge with others using same MAC
- **Local Icons**: Fallback icons served locally for offline operation
- **API Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback

### ✅ User Experience
- **Simple Setup**: Just enter 24-character User ID
- **Automatic Discovery**: Devices appear for easy addition
- **Device Customization**: Name, area, labels configurable during setup
- **Comprehensive Entities**: All calculations automated from API data
- **Real-time Updates**: 290-second polling interval optimized for battery life

## 📋 Installation Instructions

### Method 1: Manual Copy (Recommended)
1. **Copy Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the gobzigh folder to your HA config directory
   cp -r custom_components/gobzigh /path/to/homeassistant/custom_components/
   ```

2. **Restart Home Assistant**

3. **Add Integration**:
   - Go to Configuration → Integrations
   - Click "+ ADD INTEGRATION"  
   - Search for "Gobzigh"
   - Enter your User ID (24 characters)
   - Submit

4. **Add Devices**:
   - Discovered devices appear automatically
   - Click "ADD" on desired devices
   - Customize settings as needed
   - Submit to create entities

### Method 2: PowerShell Script (Windows)
```powershell
.\install.ps1 -ConfigPath "C:\path\to\homeassistant\config"
```

### Method 3: Bash Script (Linux/macOS)
```bash
./install.sh /path/to/homeassistant/config
```

## 🔧 Integration Capabilities

### API Integration
- **Endpoints**: Automatic endpoint management for device list and details
- **Authentication**: User ID-based authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Optimized polling to respect API limits
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and graceful degradation

### Calculations Implemented
All calculations from your original package configuration:

```python
# Water Height Calculation
water_height = tank_height + sensor_distance - sensor_reading

# Volume Calculations  
current_volume = water_height * width * length
max_volume = tank_height * width * length

# Percentage
percentage = (current_volume / max_volume) * 100
```

### Device Information
Each device provides complete metadata:
- Manufacturer: "Gobzigh"
- Model: Device model code (WLSV0, etc.)
- Firmware Version: Current device firmware
- MAC Address: For device consolidation
- Connection Status: Real-time connectivity

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Initial Setup Data
- `user_id`: 24-character Gobzigh User ID

### Device Discovery Data
- Automatic device detection from API
- Device type recognition
- Model-specific entity creation

### Per-Device Configuration

- Label management
- Icon selection

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Support

### Error Messages Implemented
- "No devices were retrieved" with helpful instructions
- User ID validation (must be 24 characters)
- Connection error handling with retry suggestions
- API timeout handling

### Logging Support
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.gobzigh: debug
```

### Validation Script
Run `python validate.py` to check integration structure before installation.
